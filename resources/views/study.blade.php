                <p>The Longitudinal Aging Study in Nepal is a comprehensive research initiative aimed at understanding the
                    impact of aging on cognitive health, specifically focusing on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias
                    (ADRD), in Nepal.</p>

                <p>The study seeks to explore how factors such as international labor migration and exposure to armed
                    conflict contribute to the risk of dementia and cognitive impairments in older adults.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p class="mb-0">In addition, we are exploring how chronic psychological stress impacts the transition
                        to adulthood. Using hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a reliable and non-invasive biomarker, we
                        measure long-term stress in young adults. This study is part of the Chitwan Valley Family Study
                        (CVFS), a 25-year longitudinal study of community, household, and individual factors.</p>

                <p>Population aging is becoming increasingly more common in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). As
                    a result, these countries face the growing burden of common age-associated chronic illnesses, including
                    ADRD.</p>

                <p>Nepal is a low middle-income country where the population is now aging, putting a rising number of adults
                    at risk of developing ADRD. There is little or no research in Nepal to investigate the scope and primary
                    determinants of ADRD, and even the most basic information on ADRD is currently lacking.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Urgent Need:</strong> There is an urgent need to build expertise in the design

                        aging-related changes in health to guide the development of prevention strategies and reduce the
                        burden of ADRD in Nepal.</p>
