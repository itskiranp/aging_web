                    <h3>Study Overview</h3>
                    <p>The Longitudinal Aging Study in Nepal is a comprehensive research initiative aimed at understanding
                        the impact of aging on cognitive health, specifically focusing on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related
                        Dementias (ADRD), in Nepal. The study seeks to explore how factors such as international labor
                        migration and exposure to armed conflict contribute to the risk of dementia and cognitive
                        impairments in older adults.</p>

            <h2>Study Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build Research Capacity:</strong> Train local researchers to conduct systematic research on
                    ADRD, including culturally appropriate cognitive assessments and advanced statistical analysis of
                    longitudinal data.</li>
                <li><strong>Conduct a Population-Based Study:</strong> Survey 4,000 adults aged 50 and above, along with
                    their 4,000 caregivers, and carry out follow-up assessments to estimate the prevalence and incidence of
                    ADRD.</li>
                <li><strong>Investigate Risk Factors:</strong> Analyze how long-term labor migration and exposure to armed
                    conflict impact the risk of developing ADRD and other cognitive impairments.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Study Methods</h2>
            <p>The study employs a stratified two-stage cluster sampling technique to survey a representative sample of
                4,000 older adults and their caregivers from the Chitwan Valley. Data collection includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) instruments for cognitive and physical function
                    assessments.</li>
                <li>Interviews with participants and caregivers, including assessments of height, weight, and blood
                    pressure.</li>
                <li>Biomarker collection involving plasma, serum, and red blood cells.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Timeline and Current Status</h2>
            <p>The study commenced in 2022 and is projected to conclude by 2027. The research team has successfully
                completed initial data collection and is preparing for follow-up assessments in the coming years.</p>
