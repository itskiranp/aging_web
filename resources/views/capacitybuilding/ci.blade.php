            Recognizing the need to further strengthen interviewer capacity on specialized techniques, ISER-N, with its strong infrastructure and experienced staff, organized a two-part training program on Cognitive Interviewing (CI). This aimed to upgrade research skills and ensure high-quality data collection for the CVFS-SCAN project.

                <li>General Cognitive Interviewing Techniques</li>
            </strong>

            <p style="margin:0; font-style:italic; font-size:0.95rem;">February 13 and 15, 2023 | ISER-N, Fulbari Campus</p>
            <p style="font-size:1rem; margin-top:5px; text-align:justify;">
                A two-day virtual training (two hours each day) was conducted by Ms. Margaret Hudson, Survey Director and Manager at Survey Research Operations, University of Michigan. Ms. Hudson holds a Master of Public Health and leads the Survey Research Operations Quality Control Implementation team.The training focused on the foundations of cognitive interviewing and included eight modules:
            <ul class="mb-3">
                <li>Introduction to cognitive interviewing</li>
                <li>Identifying objectives and determining approaches</li>
                <li>Identifying objectives and determining approaches</li>
                <li>Preparing materials and designing interviews</li>
                <li>Recruiting and training interviewers</li>
                <li>Conducting cognitive interviews and data analysis </li>
                <li>Reporting and data documentation</li>
            </ul>
            The sessions enhanced participantsâ€™ understanding of the purpose, preparation, and methods of cognitive interviewing. Recordings were archived for future reference.
            </p>
            <strong>Participants:</strong> 11 ISER-N staff members, including the study PI, senior research scientists, project managers, research officers, and interviewers.

                <li class="mt-3">Study-Specific Cognitive Interviewing Training (SSTT)</li>
            </strong>
            <p style="font-size:1rem; margin-top:5px; text-align:justify;">
                The Study-Specific Techniques Training (SSTT) was designed to introduce interviewers to the HCAP instruments, study protocols, and the objectives of each item in the instrument. The training emphasized techniques for:
            <ul class="mb-3">
                <li>Asking questions effectively</li>
                <li>Using appropriate probes and providing feedback</li>
                <li>Recording responses accurately</li>
            </ul>
             </p>
             <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The program was led by Ms. Emily Briceno-Abreu, Co-Investigator, and delivered through a mix of in-person lectures, recorded video observations, and hands-on practice sessions.Participants conducted three practice cognitive interviews using scripted probes developed from focus group discussions. These interviews focused on improving comprehension of terminology, refining question wording, and clarifying response categories. Insights gained informed revisions to translations and improved overall administration of cognitive measures.
           </p>
           <strong>Participants:</strong> 12 ISER-N research staff members who had completed General Interview Techniques (GIT) training.
